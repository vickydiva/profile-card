        I’m a Full Stack Developer who enjoys bringing ideas to life through clean, functional, and visually appealing web applications.
        I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, and SQL, and I`m passionate about continuous learning  exploring both the front-end experience and the back-end logic that powers it.
        I like solving problems, collaborating with others, and learning how different pieces of technology come together to make a complete system.
        I see coding not just as writing lines of logic, but as creating something meaningful that people can actually use.

      <h3 id="future-note-heading">Note to future self</h3>
      <p>
        Hey future me,  
        Remember this: you started from curiosity. You didn`t know everything, but you had the courage to begin and that`s what made all the difference.  
        There were days when the code broke for no reason or so it seemed(lol).  
        Days when tutorials felt overwhelming.  
        Days you compared yourself to other developers and felt behind.  
        But you kept showing up. You kept learning, debugging, breaking things, and fixing them again.  
        Each “error” was never a failure it was a step forward.  
        Each project you built, no matter how small, added to your skill and confidence.  
        Keep that same energy: stay curious, stay humble, and never stop learning.  
        You didn`t give up when it was hard  and that`s something to be proud of.  
        Your journey isn`t about perfection it`s about persistence.  
        And you`re doing just fine.  
        <br><br>
        {From your past self, who believed in you even on the tough days.}

      <h3 id="extra-heading">Extra thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Growth doesn`t always look like progress sometimes it`s just the patience to try again tomorrow.  
        It`s okay to not know everything; what matters is the willingness to figure things out.  
        Remember how far you`ve come from writing your first line of code to building real projects that work.  
        Collaboration over competition  you don`t have to be the best alone; learn, share, and grow with others.  
        Don`t rush success. Build the foundation strong; the rest will follow.  
        <br><br>
        Keep your creativity alive. Code is logic, yes but it`s also art.  
        Your value as a developer isn`t just in your code, but in your mindset, kindness, and consistency.  
        Celebrate small wins. One bug fixed, one concept understood they all count.
